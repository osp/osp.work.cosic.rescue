Why can't I open my eps files on OSX?
-------------------------------------

The Calendar device is not necessary available on all plateform. Change the code below

    /unrealrand {
    	(%Calendar%) currentdevparams dup
    	/Second get exch dup
    	/Minute get exch 
    	/Hour get 
    	60 mul add
    	60 mul add
    	realtime add srand
    } def

With this on

    /unrealrand {
      {(%Calendar%) currentdevparams dup} stopped
      {
        0
      }
      {
        /Second get exch dup
        /Minute get exch 
        /Hour get
        60 mul add
        60 mul add
      } ifelse
      realtime add srand
    } def


Do I need `showpage` at the end of my eps?
------------------------------------------

No.

either remove the instruction or redinfe it to a void function

    % showpage called at the end to treat this eps as a normal ps file during testing
    % showpage is redefined to nothing here for the ghostscript bug report
    % /showpage {} def
