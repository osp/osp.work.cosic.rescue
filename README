This is the Cosic visual identity repository.


= Font Embedding =

There are only two options when it comes to embedding fonts in PostScript: PostScript Type 1 or Type 42. Type 42 is generally easier to convert into from TrueType, so that is likely what we will be using.

== Testing via TTF ==

For testing purposes we can simply use TTF files (OpenType fonts will have to be converted to TTF first; see 'fonts/tools/otf2ttf'). Though this will make the git repository slightly fatter, it gives us the ability to easily switch fonts in our designs. At some point, however, we will want to create a subset font and convert it to Type42.

For testing purposes, it is necessary to maintain a Fontmap file which Ghostscript will read in order to easily load/switch a font. Included is 'fonts/tools/ttfontmap', which can be invoked as

  ttfontmap cosic/fonts > cosic/fonts/Fontmap

== Subsetting ==

In the 'fonts/tools' directory I have included an archive which contains a Ruby library for modifying TTF. Included in this archive is a tool called 'ttfsubset' which takes a TTF file and a textfile of characters as input and produces a new TTF containing only those characters as the output. There is already a text file, 'fonts/chars.txt', which contains 'COSI' and 'cosi'.

NOTE: The 'fonts/lato-black.ttf' and 'fonts/lato-bold.ttf' files are both already subsetted.

== Converting to Type 42 ==

This is as simple as installing the 'ttftotype42' program, generally available in distribution repositories.
