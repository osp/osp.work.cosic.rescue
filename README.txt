---------------

COSIC is a research group at Universiteit Leuven.

The research concentrates on the design, evaluation, and implementation of cryptographic algorithms and protocols, on the development of security architectures for information and communication systems, on the development of security mechanisms for embedded systems and the design and analysis of privacy preserving systems.

The visual identity exploits the algorithmic nature of the PostScript language at the basis of desktop publishing. The COSIC logo is different each time it is viewed or printed.

The design is Â© John Haltiwanger, Gijs de Heij and Alexandre Leray for OSP Open Source Publishing and is:
