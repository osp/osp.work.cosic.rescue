%		PROBLEMS
%			- Currently a line width of 25 is required when the font is scaled
%				to 48pt. This is necessary in order to ensure there are no 'holes'
%				in the outline mask. (Choose a smaller linewidth and you will see 
%				the effect). This is a problem because it is very likely that a 
%				slightly smaller mask radius is desired than that provided by
%				the linewidth of 25.
